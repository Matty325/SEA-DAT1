       "'Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasn\\'t too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs we were looking at the \"lunch special\" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom \"are you Chinese?\" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in \"what does that mean?\" The lady proceeded by pointing at the \"seafood pancake\" section on the menu and saying \"I don\\'t know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot.\" Good thing my mom didn\\'t hear what she said.. or else... \\r\\n\\r\\nSo we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini \"kimchi\" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn\\'t take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said \"you can\\'t take that home\". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said \"you are not allowed to take the kimchi home\". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? \"Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?\" She hesitantly gave me a lid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say \\'no stealing kimchi\\'\"... only if I said that to her face...\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service, please just go to Chodang. Chodang is WAYYY BETTER, hands down'"

       "\"Thank goodness for Sue at Mill Avenue Travel. We contacted Sue to book our honeymoon trip to St. Lucia at one of the Sandals resort.  She was great with setting everything up, booking airfare etc.  When our original airfare decided to cancel the flight, she made sure we had a comparable one booked.  The best thing she did for us was encourage us to purchase travel insurance.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at our Miami hotel at 10:30pm the night prior to leaving for St. Lucia, we had discovered Sue had left us an urgent note to contact her.  We found out a hurricane had hit St. Lucia and all of a sudden our honeymoon plans starting crumbling apart.  Because of Sue and our travel insurance (thank goodness we listened to the expert on this one!), we were able to change our honeymoon to a Sandals resort in the Bahamas and didn't miss a beat.  Sue was in constant contact with us, which calmed the craziness I was feeling (and I'm sure my new husband was relieved).  The airlines even took care of our baggage fees on the way to the Bahamas.\\r\\n  \\r\\nIf we had booked this trip on our own, we would have been up a creek without a paddle.  I most definitely would not have purchased travel insurance and our honeymoon would not have turned out to be the amazing trip it was. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will definitely be using Sue again.\""
