##_What is the question you hope to answer?_
I would like to collate several publically available data sources and APIs to investigate the linkage between campaign donations and the behavior of elected officials at the US federal level, and see if there are any statistically valid relationships. 


##_What data are you planning to use to answer that question?_
The Federal Elections Committee has detailed information on political donations to candidates, whether they are direct to campaign committees, or via SuperPACs (http://www.fec.gov/pindex.shtml). (In fact, they just released an API at https://beta.fec.gov/ to make this data more accessible.) 
It also tracks independent expenditures of groups that are not directly affiliated with candidates or parties, but often undertake activities on their behalf (such as advertising).
The FEC also tracks the activities of registered lobbyists.

Additionally, much of the voting record of the US Congress, by representative/congressman or bill, is tracked and available at https://www.govtrack.us/developers.  

There is also an interesting project here, http://dssg.uchicago.edu/lid/, which tracks similarity between bills across jursidictions, based on text similarity, and therefore makes legislitive coordination by lobbyists easier to see. (Although the data set may be too small and limited to the state level in order to be useful.)

My hope is that by collating donations and other activities that benefit a candidate, the legislative sponsorship/drafting by lobbyists who facilitated those activities, and by tracking voting records on those bills, it will be possible to identify a thread of correlation (if not causation).
This data may also be interesting to build a social network type analysis based on donor and lobbyist links.



##_What do you know about the data so far?_
I am aware of a range of data sets at the US federal level which should theoretically be possible to string together, but I have not yet evaluated them. It's possible that once I look at them more closely, I may need to change the scope of the project, look for data outside the US, or at the US state level, rather than US federal government. 



##_Why did you choose this topic?_
Earlier this year I went as a voter lobbyist to Olympia to talk to legislators and lobby on behalf of the ACLU. It was a very eye opening experience seeing the role that lobbyists play in curating information for legislators - not just fund raising for causes and arguing for positions - and how access works.
Secondly, I feel there is an imbalance in how data an analytics are used in the political world: too much is focused on targeting messages to voters and for fundraising, and not enough is focused on measuring whether our government and the people we elect are doing good work that is based on data and reason. It feels like technology is disrupting democracy, and not in a good way. So I want to do something that counter-balances that trend. So in general I'm interested in government accountabilty and transparency, and empowering voters. 

Thirdly, there seems to be a good amount of data but room for more work to be done with it.
